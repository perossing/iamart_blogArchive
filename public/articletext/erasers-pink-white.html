        <p>The eraser may seem like the most straightforward tool at an artist’s disposal: erasers remove marks and lines, simple
            as that. But, in fact <strong>there are a number of different types of erasers designed for different purposes and different materials</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Pink erasers</strong> are fairly stiff, solid and sometimes come on the ends of pencils. They were once made
            out of pink colored rubber. Now they're usually mixtures of rubber and synthetic plastics, and they're not always
            pink.</p>
        <p><strong>White erasers</strong> and brightly colored are usually made from vinyl.  Vinyl is soft so it does not damage
            paper.  Vinyl also wears well, so erasers last a long time and can be shaped to specific angles by deliberately
            wearing down one side. <strong>White vinyl erasers are sometimes called 'self-cleaning erasers'</strong> because
            even when they are covered with a black coating of graphite or charcoal on the outside, they can be restored
            to their original white color simply by rubbing them on sheet of scrap paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Pink and white erasers are best suited to clearing large areas of graphite from thicker paper</strong>. Although
            quality brands of pink and white erasers are most often problem free, they can each have their downfalls when
            not used carefully.  Pink erasers can be abrasive and may wear out or even tear thinner pages.  White erasers
            can cause smudging, especially if they have picked up oils from hands and fingers.</p>
        <p>White vinyl erasers have a long life span, but old pink erasers eventually dry out and stop working correctly. Sometimes
            they'll even leave unsightly pink streaks. So, always have a fresh one on hand.</p>
