## Art-materials info archive for iAMart.org

Using React to set up archived blog articles from previous site on an 'Articles' page for iAMart.org (Independent Art Materials Retail Marketing Co-Op).

The organization has no plans to update content as an ongoing blog, so data is pulled from a JSON file.

Completed page will use design of current iAMart.org page in a typical blog format with a list of articles to select, article snippets to preview, and tags to select article categories.
